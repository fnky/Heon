Heon
====

A very simple PHP framework built upon [klein.php](https://github.com/chriso/klein.php) - a PHP router inspired by Sinatra.

## Getting started

Make sure you meet the requirements below

* PHP

## Installation

It's easy to install Heon. Once you've met the requirements, you can just drag the files to your webserver and you should be ready to use it.

There's already made a preview on how you can set it up, but it's entirely up to yourself.
