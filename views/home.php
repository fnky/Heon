	<h5>What Now?</h5>

	<h5>What Framework Is This?</h5>
	<p>It is a very simple PHP framework. The idea behind it is making a framework that you can set a web application up with in a very small time.</p>

	<p>I originally created the framework as a boilerplate for school projects. This means it's not intended for production use. However, if you like to improve it to be good enough for that, you can help me @ Github</p>

	<p>The framework is built around the <a href="https://github.com/chriso/klein.php">klein.php</a> router, a lightweight but powerful &amp; fast router for PHP 5.3+, created by <a href="https://github.com/chriso">Chris O'Hara</a></p>
